# RSS Aggregator
A high-performance, concurrent backend service built in Go that allows users to register, add RSS feeds, and automatically scrape posts into a searchable database.

## 🚀 Features
-- **Concurrent Scraper**: A background worker pool that uses goroutines and WaitGroups to fetch multiple RSS feeds simultaneously without blocking the main API.
-- **Type-Safe SQL**: Utilizes SQLC to generate compile-time safe Go code from raw PostgreSQL queries.
-- **Database Migrations**: Managed schema evolution using Goose to handle versioned SQL migrations.
-- **Custom Authentication**: Secure API access via API Key-based authentication implemented through custom middleware.
-- **Automated Scheduling**: Intelligent fetching logic that prioritizes feeds based on their last fetched timestamp.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-- **Language**: Go (Golang) 
-- **Database**: PostgreSQL 
-- **Router**: Chi Router (with sub-routing and middleware) 
-- **SQL Toolkit**: SQLC (Type-safe query generation) 
-- **Migrations**: Goose
